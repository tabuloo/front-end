# âœ… Web3Forms Setup Complete!

## What I've Done

I've updated the code with your actual Web3Forms access key:
- **Access Key**: `13408cc4-7194-4fc2-8dc3-d497f5ccad15`
- **File Updated**: `src/services/webhookEmailService.ts`
- **Recipient**: `tablooofficial1@gmail.com`

## How It Works Now

When someone submits a restaurant registration:

1. **System tries Web3Forms** â†’ âœ… **Should work now with your real access key**
2. **Email sent automatically** â†’ ðŸ“§ **Goes directly to `tablooofficial1@gmail.com`**
3. **Success message**: "Registration submitted and email sent to admin automatically!"
4. **No modal needed** â†’ Email is sent automatically

## Email Content

The emails will contain:
- Restaurant name, type, address
- Food and crowd capacity
- Operating hours
- Owner contact details (email, phone)
- Images list
- Professional formatting

## Test It

1. **Submit a restaurant registration**
2. **Check console** - should see "Email sent successfully via Web3Forms"
3. **Check `tablooofficial1@gmail.com` inbox** - should receive the email
4. **Success message** - should say "email sent to admin automatically"

## Expected Console Output

```
Attempting to send restaurant registration email...
Sending email via Web3Forms...
Email sent successfully via Web3Forms
```

## Troubleshooting

**If emails still don't arrive:**
1. Check spam/junk folder in `tablooofficial1@gmail.com`
2. Verify Web3Forms account is active
3. Check Web3Forms dashboard for delivery status

**If you see errors:**
1. Check console for specific error messages
2. Verify the access key is correct
3. Make sure Web3Forms account is not suspended
